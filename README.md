# NumberGuessingGame
# Overview

This program is a simple number guessing game written in the Java language. The computer will choose a number and the user will have to guess the number, the computer will give hints on if the number is higher or lower than the number guessed. The program reads and writes to a text file of the numbers guessed. 


I wrote this program with the purpose of demonstrating my knowledge of the operation and syntax of the java language, and show use of the terminal on my mac computer.
